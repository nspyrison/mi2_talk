# Scatterplot matrix

&lt;img src="images/index.rmd/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
_Chambers, 1983_

```
GGally::ggpairs()
```

- Scalability?
- Structure in 3+ variables?

---

# Parallel coordinate plot

&lt;img src="images/index.rmd/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="50%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
_Ocagne, 1885_
```
GGally::ggparcoord()
```

- Scalability?
- Poor comparison across non-adjacent variables; asymmetric across variable order
- Correlation is harder to extract

---

# Dimension reduction

**Linear**

- *Affine* transformations: "parrellel lines stay parrellel"
- Examples:
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA), oriented by variance
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), oriented by the separation of the supervised class
    - Visualization _tours_ (next section)

--

**Nonlinear**

- Other transformations: variable interactions, exponents, _etc._
- Examples:
    - Sammon mapping
    - Self Organizing Maps (SOM)
    - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE)
    - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)

# Nonlinear projections

Good news; you are already familiar with `\((p=3, d=2)\)` non-linear projections!

&lt;img src="./figures/intuition_nonlinear_proj.PNG" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
[wikipedia - Map projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection)

- Inconsistent space; hard to explain &amp; interpret
- Many methods, many hyperparmeters; how _faithful_ is the representation?

“All non-linear projections are wrong, but some are useful.”
&lt;br&gt;--- Anatasios Panagiotelis (play on George Box’s quote about models)

&lt;!-- quote from: NUMBAT Seminar, 04/20/2020 --&gt;

&lt;!-- quote about models) --&gt;

# Linear projections -- intuition

You are already familiar with `\((p=3, d=2)\)` linear projections!

&lt;img src="./figures/intuition_linear_proj.PNG" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
LDA: _Fischer, 1936_, supervised cluster separation

- Not all orientations hold interesting structure
- But information/structure could be gleaned from rotation

---

# Linear projections  -- notation

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/linear_proj_wide.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Using linear combinations of variables we can find bases (orientation) that separate clusters the most (oLDA)
&lt;br&gt;

--
__Caveat:__

- Often times our output space is of the same dimensionality as our input space
    - PCA returns a `\(pxp\)` basis
    - The reduction happens when the space is approximated with fewer components, often involving guided, but _subjective_ selection (scree plot)

---

# Linear projections -- traditional approch

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1) Scale each variable to [0, 1] or by standard deviations away from the mean&lt;br&gt;
2) Some people 'whiten' or 'sphere' transform the covariance matrix to an identity matrix; should be justified&lt;br&gt;
3) If `\(p\)` is sizable, say more than 10 or, may do an initial round of dimension reduction to get to a realistic view-space&lt;br&gt;
    - Typically with PCA by eyeballing an elbow in a scree plot
    - "We approximate 90% of the variation of our 20 variable in the first 5 principal components"
4) Visualize with data- or component- space with scatterplot matrix, _etc._

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Static, discrete, and orthogonal views**

---

# Tours

- Instead of viewing only static orthogonal views, let's *animate* small changes in the basis over time
    - Object permanence between frames; can see observations and cluster moving together

  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Tour type &lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;th style="text-align:left;"&gt; Target bases &lt;/th&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; grand &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; random bases &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; guided &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; objective function (simulated annealing) &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; manual &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; change the contribution of selected variable &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; local &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;td style="text-align:left;"&gt; random bases within a local vacinity &lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

--

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- The grand tour is good for EDA, but selects target frames randomly, no objective function.
    - Bill length is important for distinguishing the ornage cluster
- Component spaces and grand tour have no means to "steer" the projection 
- Look at it in more detail: control its contribution with a _manual tour_

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
__Caveat:__

- Tours needn't project to `\(d=2\)`
    - 1D density curves
    - 3D scatterplot
    - `\(d~|~d&lt;p\)` Parallel coordinate plot, Chernoff faces

# SHAP values

- FIFA 2020 data, 5000 observations, ~35 skill measurements aggregated to 9 variables, Y: wages [2020 Euros]
- Model: Random forest, regress wages given 9 skill measurements
- SHAP is a model-agnostic local explanation
- Approximate linear variable importance at one observation; the median importance, permuting over combinations of the explanatory variables

**The model has very different variable importance across the player position**

# Cheem, concept

- Create a black-box model
- Extract explanations for every variable (constitutionally expensive)
- __Global view__: approximate data- and attribution-space side-by-side
    - Explore with liked brushing, tooltips, interactive tabular display
    - Select a primary and comparison point to explore their explanation
- __Cheem radial tour__:
    - Primary point attribution of the becomes the initial basis
    - Evaluate/explore the explanation by testing the support of variable contributions

--
&lt;br&gt;
- Generalizable to all compatible model * explanation pairings
- Illustrate with random forests and a tree SHAP (reduced computational complexity)

- Select a primary and comparison point, typically misclassified and neighboring correctly classified
- Use the SHAP values of the primary point as the basis, perform a 1D radial (manual) tour to interrogate the models explanation

???

- PC1:2 of data (left) and SHAP (right)
- Points color and shape are mapped to *predicted* cluster
- Misclassified have red circle

# Cheem radial tour

- Primary &amp; comparison observation: dashed &amp; dotted lines
- SHAP values displayed as parallel coordinate lines on basis
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- **The misclassified point downplays the weight on V2; this discrepancy is a measure of how differently this misclassified point is, compared with its peers**
