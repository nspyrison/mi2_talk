# Dimension reduction

**Linear**

- *Affine* transformations: "parrellel lines stay parrellel"
- Examples:
    - Principal Component Analysis (PCA), oriented by variance
    - Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), oriented by the separation of the supervised class
    - Visualization _tours_ (next section)

--

**Nonlinear**

- Other transformations: variable interactions, exponents, _etc._
- Examples:
    - Sammon mapping
    - Self Organizing Maps (SOM)
    - t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE)
    - Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)

---

# Nonlinear projections

Good news; you are already familiar with `\((p=3, d=2)\)` non-linear projections!

&lt;img src="./figures/intuition_nonlinear_proj.PNG" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
[wikipedia - Map projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection)

- Inconsistent space; hard to explain &amp; interpret
- Many methods, many hyperparmeters; how _faithful_ is the representation?

“All non-linear projections are wrong, but some are useful.”
&lt;br&gt;--- Anatasios Panagiotelis (play on George Box’s quote about models)
&lt;!-- quote from: NUMBAT Seminar, 04/20/2020 --&gt;

# Linear projections -- intuition

Good news; you are already familiar with ($p=3, d=2$) linear projections!

&lt;img src="./figures/intuition_linear_proj.PNG" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

- Not all orientations hold interesting structure
- But structural information could be gleaned from rotation

---

# Linear projections  -- rotation

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;img src="./figures/linear_proj_wide.png" width="100%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;
LDA: _Fischer, 1936_, supervised cluster separation

Given the distributions and orientations of different clusters, find a basis (rotation) that separate clusters the most

--

- Often times our output space is of the same dimensionality as our input space
    - eg. PCA returns a `\(pxp\)` basis
    - The reduction happens when the space is approximated with fewer components, often involving guided, but _subjective_ selection. eg. Finding an "elbow" in screeplot
    - Or worse -- only showing PC1:2, with no recognition or discussion of the others

---

# Linear projections -- traditional process

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
1) Scale each variable to [0, 1] or by standard deviations away from the mean (z-score)&lt;br&gt;
2) Some people 'whiten' or 'sphere' transform the covariance matrix to an identity matrix; should be justified&lt;br&gt;
3) If `\(p\)` is sizable, say more than 10 or, may first approximate the data in fewer components to get to a realistic dimensionality to view
- Typically with PCA by eyeballing an elbow in the screeplot
- "We approximate 90% of the variation of our 20 variable in the first 5 principal components"
- Alternative mathematical approximations: "intrinsic dimensionality estimation"

4) Visualize data- or component- space

--
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Visualize _one rotation (or more if lucky);_ **static, not interactive**

---

# Tours

- Instead of viewing only static views, *animate* small changes in the basis over time
    - Object permanence between frames; can see observations and cluster moving together

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

--

&lt;br&gt;
- The grand tour is good for EDA, but selects target frames randomly, no objective function
- Hypothesis; Bill length is important for distinguishing the orange cluster
- Issue; Component spaces and grand tour have no user interaction to "steer" the basis
- Response; Control its contribution with a _manual tour_

## Local explanation of a black-box models &amp; application of radial tours, _cheem_

---

# Local explanation

- Given a non-linear ("blackbox") model, how can we maintain interpretability
- Approximation of the linear variable importance to the model in the vicinity of _one_ observation of a model

# Cheem, concept

- Create a non-linear model
- Extract explanations for every observation (computationally expensive)
- __Global view__: approximate data- and attribution-space side-by-side
    - Explore with liked brushing, tooltips, interactive tabular display
    - Select a primary and comparison point to explore their explanation
- __Cheem radial tour__:
    - Primary point attribution of the becomes the initial basis
    - Evaluate/explore the explanation by testing the support of variable contributions

__New__, at a github server near you,

- model- and local explanation-agnostic (BYO)

- Select a primary and comparison point, typically misclassified and neighboring correctly classified
- Use the SHAP values of the primary point as the basis, perform a 1D radial (manual) tour to interrogate the models explanation

???

- PC1:2 of data (left) and SHAP (right)

- Misclassified have red circle

# Cheem radial tour

- Primary &amp; comparison observation: dashed &amp; dotted lines
- SHAP values displayed as parallel coordinate lines on basis
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

- **The misclassified point downplays the weight on V2; this discrepancy is a measure of how differently this misclassified point is, compared with its peers**

# Demo the app

Explore interactively with an R shiny application

&lt;br&gt;
Local resources:

```r
cheem::run_app()
```
&lt;br&gt;

- Externally hosted shiny app (outdated): [ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/cheem_initial/](https://ebsmonash.shinyapps.io/cheem_initial/)
- __cheem__ (back) on CRAN soon, available on GitHub: [github.com/nspyrison/cheem](https://github.com/nspyrison/cheem)

# Cheem -- getting started

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
```
## Install cheem development version &amp; its CRAN dependancies.
remotes::install_github("nspyrison/cheem", dependencies = TRUE)
## Run the {cheem} app
cheem::run_app()
## BYO data, model, local explanation:
?cheem::cheem_ls
```

# Namesake

- __Cheem__ are a fictional race of bipedal trees from the Dr. Who universe
- (Original implementation) on tree based models, __DALEX__ ecosystem

This research was supported by an Australian government Research Training Program (RTP) scholarship. These slides created in __R__ using __rmarkdown__ and __xaringan__ *(R Core Team, 2021; Xie et al. 2018; Xie, 2018)*

&lt;br&gt;
_Tentatively,_ IFF may support continued development of related content; broader preprocessing functions, more/better geom-like displays
